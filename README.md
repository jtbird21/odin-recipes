# odin-recipes
## Purpose of Project
This was an assignment from The Odin Project, a course I have been taking to begin my initial pursuit of being a software developer.
## Project Outcome
During this project I learned how to apply my beginning knowledge of html and build a simple website about some cooking recipes. I have implemented headings, paragraphs, and ordered and unordered lists. I added relative links as well as images.
